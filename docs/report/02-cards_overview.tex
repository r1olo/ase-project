\section{Cards overview}\label{sec:cards-overview}

The cards set is based on the twenty regions of Italy.

Each card is represented by an image of the region, its total score and the category subscores which it is based upon --- namely \textit{Economy}, \textit{Environment}, \textit{Food}, and \textit{Special}.
The scores of \textit{Economy}, \textit{Environment} and \textit{Food} were assigned on the basis of real data, meanwhile the \textit{Special} score was assigned according to subjective criteria.
