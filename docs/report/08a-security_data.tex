\subsubsection{Input Sanitization}
The username field provided in the request body sent by the client must be sanitized before being processed.

The username is used by the Players Service to store personal information about the user as a player.
To ensure the input is safe, the following operations are performed:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item verify that the key exists and the value is not empty;
    \item validate if the length is within the allowed range;
    \item ensure the string contains only allowed characters.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Encryption at Rest}
To protect users' sensitive information, all data stored in the Users Database is encrypted at rest.
This sensitive information primarily consists of user credentials.

The database itself performs field-level encryption, automatically encrypting data when written and decrypting it when read by the Players Service.
