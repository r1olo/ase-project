Assuming two players are authenticated, the game proceeds through the following API calls.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \api{POST /enqueue}: each player must enqueue to find another player and start a game.
    \item \api{GET /status}: each player must poll the status endpoint to check if a player has been found and a match has been created.
    \item \api{POST /matches/<match\_id>/deck}: each player must submit their deck for the match.
    \item\label{item:play-round}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item \api{GET /matches/<match\_id>/round}: each player can check the current round status.
        \item \api{POST /matches/<match\_id>/moves/<round\_id>}: each player must submit their move for the current round.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \api{GET /matches/<match\_id>}: each player can check the match status.
    \item \api{GET /matches/<match\_id>/history}: each player can check the match history.
    \item \api{GET /leaderboards}: each player can check his ranking and overall score.
\end{enumerate}
Step~\ref{item:play-round} must be repeated until the match ends.
