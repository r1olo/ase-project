\section{Game Flow}\label{sec:game-flow}

Assuming two players logged in, the game flow of APIs calls is as follows.
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \api{POST /enqueue}: each player must enqueue to find another player and start a game.
    \item \api{GET /status}: each player must poll the status endpoint to check if a player has been found and a match has been created.
    \item \api{POST /matches/<match\_id>/deck}: each player must submit their deck for the match.
    \item \begin{enumerate}
        \item \api{GET /matches/<match\_id>/round}: each player must check the current round state.
        \item \api{POST /matches/<match\_id>/moves/<round\_id>}: each player must submit their move for the current round.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \api{GET /matches/<match\_id>}

    \item The game starts with a lobby where players can join or create games.
    \item Once two players are in a lobby, the game can begin.
    \item Each player is dealt a hand of cards.
    \item The game proceeds in rounds, with players taking turns.
    \item During a player's turn, they can play a card from their hand.
    \item The effects of the played card are resolved.
    \item If a player's health reaches zero, they lose the game.
    \item The last player remaining wins the game.
\end{enumerate}
