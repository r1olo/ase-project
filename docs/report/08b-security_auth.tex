\subsection{Authorization and Authentication}\label{subsec:security-auth}

The system implements a stateless, distributed authentication architecture.
Instead of relying on centralized session validation --- which introduces latency and a single point of failure --- the architecture utilizes JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) signed with asymmetric cryptography.

In this schema, the Authentication Server retains exclusive access to the private key, while the other microservices utilize the corresponding public key to independently verify the token's integrity and authenticity.
This verification logic is implemented via the \texttt{@jwt\_required} decorator, which intercepts incoming requests to validate the signature.

This approach ensures horizontal scalability, as validation overhead is distributed across the microservices rather than concentrated on the authentication service.
