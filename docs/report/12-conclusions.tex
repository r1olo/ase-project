\section{Conclusions}

The project's objective was to foster teamwork, tackle larger-scale software challenges, and acquire practical, modern skills.
We experienced the entire project lifecycle, from scratch to implementation, adopting a productive \textit{DevOps} mindset.

A key example is the use of user stories: while they might seem simple or \textit{gamified}, they are crucial for defining software requirements before coding, ultimately saving time on architectural decisions.
