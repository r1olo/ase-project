\section{Game Rules}\label{sec:game-rules}

The game is a round-based strategy game played between two players.

Before the match, each player constructs a deck of cards before the match begins, choosing from a collection of available cards.
Once the decks have been submitted and validated, the game begins.

The objective is to win the majority of rounds, by playing cards strategically over multiple rounds.
During each round, a random category is picked and both players simultaneously choose a card from their hand.
The chosen cards are revealed, and the player with the higher score for that category wins the round.

The game lasts for a predetermined number of rounds until the end.
The player with the most wins is declared the winner.
