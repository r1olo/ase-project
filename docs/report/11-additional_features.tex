\FloatBarrier\section{Additional Features}\label{sec:additional-features}

The endpoints listed below were not part of the initial project requirements but were added as additional features.
These are the ones related to the implementation of the friendship system.
As before, the numbering corresponds to the indexes of the user stories defined in the project documentation.
\begin{enumerate}[start=36]
    \item \api{POST /players/me/friends/<username>}
    \item \api{GET /players/me/friends} \\
        \api{GET /players/me/friends/<username>}
    \item \api{DELETE /players/me/friends/<username>}
    \item \api{GET /matches/<match\_id>/history/<player\_id>}
\end{enumerate}
This feature allows players to have friends within the game, enhancing the game experience.
It is implemented in the Players Service, and it is also used by the Game Engine so that players can see the match history of their friends.

In addition, the project also included the original design of all cards used in the game.
